      "My journey into mobile app development began during my college years, when I started exploring Flutter. I was fascinated by the ability to build beautiful, high-performance apps for both Android and iOS using a single codebase. While still studying, I began taking on freelance projects, which gave me valuable hands-on experience with real-world clients and timelines.After graduating, I transitioned into a fulltime Flutter developer role at a tech company. I've been working as part of a collaborative development team, contributing to production level apps and continuing to learn best practices for scalable mobile development.I'm passionate about clean code, smooth user experiences, and staying updated with the latest in mobile tech. As I grow in this field, I’m excited to keep building meaningful products and tackling new challenges";
